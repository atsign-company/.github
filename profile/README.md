### Now for a little internet optimism

Welcome to The @ Company Github Organization, home to the creators of
[The @ Platform](https://atsign.dev/docs/).

You may also wish to take a look at
[The @ Foundation](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/)
org, which hosts the open source repos for the @platform.

## Our key public repos

These repos hold open source projects that aren't part of the @platform,
which is why they're here rather than over at The @ Foundation.

* [at_dockerfiles](https://github.com/atsign-company/at_dockerfiles) -
Dockerfiles to create build, run and test images for Dart applications across
multiple architectures.
* [dump_cards](https://github.com/atsign-company/dump_cards) -
Scripts to dump cards from a GitHub project column into a CSV file that can
be imported into planningpoker.com
* [labels](https://github.com/atsign-company/labels) -
Repo to push a standard set of labels to the other repos we use so that we
have consistent labeling

### Forks

There are a few wonderful open source projects that we use, where we've made
some tweaks, as well as trying whenever possible to contribute improvements
back upstream to the original maintainers.

* [filebin2](https://github.com/atsign-company/filebin2) -
Filebin is a web application that facilitates convenient file sharing over the
web.
* [shepherd](https://github.com/atsign-company/shepherd) -
Docker swarm service for automatically updating your services whenever their
base image is refreshed
