Welcome to the Atsign Github Organization, home to the creators of
[The atPlatform](https://docs.atsign.com).

You may also wish to take a look at
[The Atsign Foundation](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/)
org, which hosts the open source repos for the atPlatform.

## Our key public repos

These repos hold open source projects that aren't part of the atPlatform,
which is why they're here rather than over at The Atsign Foundation.

* [at_dockerfiles](https://github.com/atsign-company/at_dockerfiles) -
Dockerfiles to create build, run and test images for Dart applications across
multiple architectures. Was deprecated when Arm supported landed in the
official Dart Docker image, but brought back for RISC-V.
* [At_Swarm_Load](https://github.com/atsign-company/at_swarm_load) -
GCE Custom metrics for 5m load average and root volume utilisation.
* [certinfo-action](https://github.com/atsign-company/certinfo-action) -
A GitHub Action to add the certinfo tool to a workflow so that certificates
can be validated.
* [dump_cards](https://github.com/atsign-company/dump_cards) -
Scripts to dump cards from a GitHub project column into a CSV file that can
be imported into planningpoker.com
* [labels](https://github.com/atsign-company/labels) -
Repo to push a standard set of labels to the other repos we use so that we
have consistent labeling

### Forks

There are a few wonderful open source projects that we use, where we've made
some tweaks, as well as trying whenever possible to contribute improvements
back upstream to the original maintainers.

* [filebin2](https://github.com/atsign-company/filebin2) -
Filebin is a web application that facilitates convenient file sharing over the
web.
* [shepherd](https://github.com/atsign-company/shepherd) -
Docker swarm service for automatically updating your services whenever their
base image is refreshed
